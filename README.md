# Intro
A simple repo illustrating public access

This is just a dummy repository with a single README.md file.

Its purpose is to show how public access to the repo works and possibly illustrate the use of Issues at GitHub.

The public can read the repo and issues but must have a GitHub account to submit an Issue.
